## Further Analysis

Metrics like total sales, profit generated, and units sold per supervisor would be valuable.  Understanding the performance drivers for top performers could help improve the performance of others.

- **Brand Performance by Region:**  Understanding which brands perform best in which regions could inform targeted marketing and sales strategies.
- **Sales Trend Analysis:** Analyzing sales trends over time (e.g., monthly or quarterly) would provide insights into seasonality and growth patterns.  This would require time-series data.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Investigating potential correlations between different variables (e.g., advertising spend and sales, pricing and sales volume) could reveal valuable insights.

## Conclusion

The sales dashboard provides a good overview of sales performance for the year 2023-24. The key findings include the top-selling product categories, the leading brands, and the geographical distribution of sales.
